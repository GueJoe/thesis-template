\chapter{Method}\label{ch:method}

In this chapter, we're actually using some code!

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption={This is an example of a listing with code in tex},captionpos=b,label=code: code in tex]
x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")

\end{lstlisting}

You can also include listings from a file directly:

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,caption={This is an example of a listing from a file},captionpos=b, label=code: code from file]{listings/example.py}

This was already told in \autoref{ch:intro}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item One Point
	\item The other point
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item First
	\item Second
\end{enumerate}

This \emph{word} ist emphasized.

Inline Listing is also possible: \lstinline|Set<Words> findDistinct();|
\par
As you can see in \autoref{code: code from file}
